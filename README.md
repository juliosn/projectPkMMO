> Academic project carried out in 2022 that consists of the creation of a thematic website following the pre-established models. So, I chose the game "PokeMMO" as the theme.


### Adjustments and improvements

In the future, the project will undergo a 'reboot' and other technologies and frameworks will be implemented, with the aim of improving the project's quality and functionalities.
